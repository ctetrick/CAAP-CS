        <h4>Our Stylists</h4>
        <p>The stylists here at The Polished Puppy were trained in France's greatest salon to handle all of your puppies needs. Our top stylist Janet describes her training.</p>
        <blockquote> "In France, we were trained by the greatest, put through the most intensive training, and came out with unique qualifications. I once had to shave a hungry bulldog whilst simultaneously grooming a pregnant cat. It was difficult, I will confess, but I now know I can groom just about any animal, even your puppy." - Janet</blockquote>
