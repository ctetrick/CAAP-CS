    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>While my job history has been rocky, I have always wanted money. Ever since a young age, I have had complete faith in the capitalist system of this country. With greed comes success, and capitalism is key to that. This buisness is highly questionable, and it is actually a money laundering operation for the Russian mob, but the important thing is is that I own a real, genuine buisness. It is a way for me to make money.</p>
