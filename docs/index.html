    <h3 id="AboutUs"><em>About Us</em></h3>
        <p>The Polished Puppy is a grooming salon specializing in puppies, and we have been operating for the past 5 years in the Hyde Park area. We only hire the most qualified stylists to care for your puppy. Our salon is both PETA and NHL certified in animal care and safety.</p>
        <h4>Our Stylists</h4>
            <p>The stylists here at The Polished Puppy were trained in France's greatest salon to handle all of your puppy's needs. Our top stylist Janet describes her training.</p>
               <blockquote> "In France, we were trained by the greatest, put through the most intensive training, and came out with unique qualifications. I once had to shave an angry bulldog whilst simultaneously grooming a pregnant cat. It was difficult, I will confess, but I now know I can survive just about any animal, even your puppy." - Janet</blockquote>
