#Python Choose Your Own Adventure Game

#Title: The Mystery of Campus North

#By: Christina Tetrick

#General Description:

This game is partially functioning. It works up until a death or the end of the game, and I don't know how to solve the problem. The scoreboard and leadboard work, at least I think they do, even though the game cannot access them in its current state. I'm sorry.

#How to Run:

To run this game, since macs cannot use .exe files, type the code:
python3 game.py
into your terminal.

#Future Directions:

The end/death problem in this game can be resolved. It can also be made more complex.
