Comments:
- You have to fix the structure of your directories for this lab.
    --> follow the hierarchy template I gave you in the lab1_resources.
- You should validate all pages (e.g. profile too)
- Back button should just have a link to the page, history function can be buggy (e.g. last page wasn't the home page).
- all content should be in the <body>, nothing goes after it but the </html> tag.
- Great job, keep practicing!
